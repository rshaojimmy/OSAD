Pytorch codes for Open-set Adversarial Defense <a href=https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123620664.pdf> (pdf) </a> in ECCV 2020 

Challenges in open-set recogntion and adversarial robustness. (a) Conventional CNN classiﬁers fail in the presence of both open-set and adversarial images. (b) Open-set recognition methods can successfully identify open-set samples, but fail on adversarial samples. (c) Adversarial defense methods are unable to identify open-set samples. (d) Proposed method can identify open-set images and it is robust to adversarial images.

Thus this paper proposes a new research problem named Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD) where adversarial attacks are studied under an open-set setting. We propose an Open-Set Defense Network (OSDN) that learns a latent feature space that is robust to adversarial attacks and informative to identify open-set samples.

Network structure of the proposed Open-Set Defense Network (OSDN). It consists of four components: encoder, decoder, open-set classiﬁer and transformation classifier.
